        <h2>Problem statement</h2>
        <p>
          RISE has gone through a major reorganization the last couple of years, and as a result has
          changed it’s approach to generating work, with a bigger emphasis on consulting. I was
          asked to identify possible improvements to the current workflow, in order to activate
          employees to participate more in project generation.
        </p>
        <h2>Task & methodology</h2>
        <p>
          I facilitated a workshop based on the Lightning Decision Jam model. The goal of an LDJ is
          to quickly identify challenges, voting on the most important resulting clusters, reshaping
          those into “how might we” solutions, and then refine those further into actionable lists.
          Since the team was dispersed over the country we used a virtual Mural board, and thanks to
          the very structured approach of LDJ we were able to rapidly identified pressing issues for
          individuals and the group as a whole, resulting in actionable next steps.
        </p>
        <h2>My contribution</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Facilitated three workshops with 15 participants.</li>
          <li>
            Researched previous materials from workshops, conferences and meeting minutes to get an
            overview of the issue and identify an appropriate workshop model.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed the Mural flow and interactions, including housekeeping and adapting the board
            between sessions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Findings & impact</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The result of the workshops was an actionable list of 11 tasks that the team wanted to
            focus on in order to improve their work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Based on an effort/impact map the team agreed on one task to proceed with, and we
            implemented this insight into an actionable task, and reached a decision on “who should
            do what until when.”
          </li>
          <li>
            The workshop revealed a lack of agreement on the implications of the reorganization, and
            these insights were used in a later three day workshop to harmonize the goals.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many participants were positively surprised with how much they managed to accomplish in
            very little time, and how practical the results were.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key learnings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For this particular workshop, having clearer expectations of attendance numbers
            beforehand would have allowed me to choose a more flexible model to avoid bottlenecks.
          </li>
          <li>
            The participants enjoyed the structured and prescriptive guidelines, which allowed
            everyone to focus on the goals with little distraction.

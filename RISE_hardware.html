        <h2>Problem statement</h2>
        <p>
          The client is a manufacturer of household appliances and had employed RISE to conduct
          usability studies of new functions in a dishwasher, in order to identify issues with
          affordance and usability.Testing takes time and costs money, but the cost of implementing
          even seemingly simple features that turn out to be faulty or unusable far outweighs any
          upfront testing expenses, not to mention potential reputation damage.
        </p>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          Test subjects were invited to the RISE UX Lab in Stockholm to perform scenarios under
          observation by UX researchers and client stakeholders. Subsequent tagging and thematic
          analysis is compiled into insights for the client to incorporate into their design work.
        </p>
        <h2>My contribution</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Wrote test scenarios to identify usability issues and measure the level of fail/pass
            states.
          </li>
          <li>
            Assisted with the live user studies and the post-test analysis with clients and RISE
            team.

          <li>Proof reading of the finished client report.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Findings & impact</h2>
        <p>
          Of the three functions tested, none of the features were obvious and one was downright
          unusable for the majority of the test subjects. The SEQ was despite this quite high and
          the desirability of the functions was likewise high. The design team was satisfied with
          the findings and will incorporate the insights going forward.
        </p>
        <h2>Key learnings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A pre-test with a single user and client stakeholders identified multiple issues that
            did not crop up in the planning phase, and made the test better.
          </li>
          <li>
            Having multiple levels of triggers for fail and pass states gives a more nuanced result.
          </li>
          <li>
            When dealing with multiple stakeholders with diverging goals (marketing, design,
            engineering) making sure that all agree on the purpose of the test is paramount.
